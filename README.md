# Web-Connect-Hobby
Web Connect Hobby is created to fulfill the final project assignment for the Programming and Testing of Web Applications course. This website is founded on the basis of IT Del students sharing similar hobbies but struggling to develop them due to the absence of a discussion forum. Hence, we built a website to address this need.
